# lokinet win32

win32 platform bits compiled with msvc for lokinet, because Microsoft "Loves Linux" so much they can't even publish redistributable headers for the parts of their windows api that make windows functional and useful to free software so we have to compile a binary blob to make stuff work on their mediocre platform that doesn't even have a proper firewall or net api.
